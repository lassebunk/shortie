== About Shortie
Shortie makes it easy to shorten URLs with any service directly from your Ruby applications.

== How to make your own shortener
Take a look at the shorteners in lib/shortie/shorteners to se how a shortener is made.
Basically it's just doing it like this:

module Shortie
  module Shorteners
    class Bitly < BaseShortener
      def shorten
				# communicating with bit.ly.
				return url
      end
    end
    Service.register("bitly", "bit.ly", Bitly)
  end
end

After creating a new shortener please send me a pull request and I'll implement your shortener as soon as possible.
